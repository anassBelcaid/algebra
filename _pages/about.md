The objective of this course is the introduce the first year student to basic
concepts of algebra such as relations, sets and applications. The first part we
teach the concept of applications, one-to-one mapping and binary relations. The
second part will switch to structural concepts by introducing the notions of
groups and rings. Finally, the third part, we touch on the concept of linearity
and vectorial spaces.


Upon completion of this course, you should be able to 

- Identify the basic properties of applications.
- Manipulate Polynomials and their roots.
- Identify the properties of a group.
- Easily solve linear system and transformations on linear spaces.
